This is the code I used for my rubik's cube solving robot. The solving algorithm I am using is the one implemented by [hkociemba](https://github.com/hkociemba/RubiksCube-TwophaseSolver). I am also using [CubeLuke's](https://github.com/CubeLuke/Rubiks-Cube-Solver) solver for the scrambling of the cube and for keeping track of the cube's state.
